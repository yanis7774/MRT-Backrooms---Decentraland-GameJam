# MRT-Backrooms Decentraland GameJam
Meta Residence Tower submission for GameJam 2023


The Meta Residence Tower Backrooms project utilizes several new SDK7 technologies and newly developed systems. 

## Main Features

- A core concept based on a roguelike game where the player must navigate through rooms to achieve their goals and survive.
- Procedural generation of maze-like levels.
- Random generation of room decorations, furniture, and level rewards.
- Functional enemies equipped with AI and unique abilities.
- Neural network-generated music that creates a surreal, dream-like atmosphere.
- Neural network-generated surroundings to enhance immersion.
- Storytelling through audiotapes that narrate the eerie lore of this dreamlike world.

## Game Areas

1. The backrooms of MRT apartments are haunted by ghostly creatures.
2. Classic luminal space backrooms where the room itself tries to hunt the player down.
3. A hellish area inspired by classic horror games where players must utilize all their resources to survive.

## Open Source Systems and Content

We have finished and are ready to provide open-source access to the following systems and content:

- Interaction with the Colyseus server.
- DB Interaction.
- UI Example.
- A fog system capable of real-time player tracking without lag, made possible by SDK7.
- Procedural generation of dungeons from basic shapes. This system is versatile and can be used in any project requiring it.
- Maze complexity adaptable to any difficulty level, ranging from a short 4-room tour to a maze of tens of rooms filled with dangers and discoveries.
- Evolving enemy and maze difficulty throughout the game.
- A decal application system alongside procedural generation, capable of applying randomly selected textures to generate unique levels. New ones are easy to add.
- A system for generating doors that block paths on generated levels, including door frames for empty ones.
- Back-end integration of player health control and leaderboard.
- An extended navigation system for AI, coupled with a mapping system to support randomly generated environments.
- AI capabilities to haunt the player, with teleportation and movement speed regulation.
- Audible cues to telegraph enemy actions.
- Health and end-game systems.
- Inventory and item pickup systems.
- A UI system that can support an inventory and health system.
- A universal tooltip system for UI, for both fluff and tutorial purposes. The player is properly notified about what to do and how the mechanics work.
- Support for playing multiple sounds simultaneously from one source.
- A random selector for an ambiance that's tied to procedural generation.

## AI Tools Used

- Midjourney - Art
